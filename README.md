## Chris Abdo
Graduate from Makers Academy looking to fulfil my passion for solving complex problems in a role in software engineering. My transition into software development enabled me to apply this passion towards designing and creating products with robust, resilient and test-driven code. Products that add value to the lives of consumers. In achieving this, I bring strong leadership, innovative and interpersonal skills developed from my past professional and volunteering experiences. I relish the challenge of learning new things and am now teaching myself Python through personal side projects, as well as carrying out the AWS Cloud Practitioners Course.

## Experience

**MG Vintage** (December 2018 - July 2020)  Head of Supplier Coordination

- Student run start up platform offering an online vintage clothes service, allowing members to rent and swap out items as part of their subscription.
- Oversaw communication with suppliers both domestically and overseas. This venture provided me with experience working with a start-up consumer platform, negotiating wholesale prices, logistics and a strategic insight into UX, and handling payments over a variety of software platforms.

**Freepoint Commodities** (August 2019)  
Intern

- Analysed commodity trading strategies used in tandem with indicator software such as ADX and parabolic SARs that had been developed for tracking price movements.
- Gained experience in learning the basics of algorithmic trading by shadowing the algorithms trading desk aimed at developing trading strategies across oil, natural gas and metal markets.
- Worked in back office processing areas. Tasked with calculations and back testing the payment flow using the systems CXL and EIPP from trade verification to payment release.

## Skills

#### Leadership

- Bank of America Merrill Lynch Spring Insight Week: My team were tasked with researching and presenting the development of the Fintech sector over the past five years. Due to my interest in the industry, I put myself forward to lead the team. I delegated roles based on our individual strengths into analysis and creative teams. The result of this enabled us to give a highly informative presentation on the growth of the industry based on captivating research and a well-designed project.

#### Adaptability

- My ability to adapt was paramount in the delivery of a meal for the homeless community as part of the volunteer team at the Foodcycle Project. I had to shift between roles and tasks seamlessly in order to produce the end product for our client-base.


#### Collaboration

- MG Vintage: Tasked with travelling to Italy to purchase stock for new members. This involved negotiating wholesale prices with foreign suppliers whilst establishing a constructive relationship for future deals. The application of effective communication throughout this process led to MG Vintage establishing a primary network of suppliers, allowing us to purchase products at extremely favourable rates.
- Student-led Intramural Football Committee: Working with the teams and local businesses to set up sponsorship deals. Charity shops, barbers, cafes and more were given free advertising in exchange for student discounts.

#### Attention to Detail

- Freepoint Commodities: I spent three weeks in back-end operations, using logging software such as CXL and EIPP to verify and backcheck trades on global markets. By following a process throughout the series of tasks, I was able to ensure confidence in my procedures before sending trades off for payment and delivery. Subsequently, my responsibilities grew to the construction of company-wide daily statistic sheets, displaying the daily net value of overall trades on each market.

#### Perseverance

- Freddie's Flowers Salesman: Failing to sell any units in my first week as a door-to-door salesman, I chose to carefully analyse my performance with the help of feedback and support from my team. This led to me picking out two key areas of improvement: resilience and confidence. Consequently, took it upon myself to 'mock pitch' to members of my team until I felt that these targets had been met. Although the effects were not felt immediately, 6 weeks later I rewarded by management for being the top salesman in my team over a three-week period.

## Hobbies
