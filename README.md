## Chris Abdo
A 2020 University graduate now fully immersed in the world of software development after completing a 16-week bootcamp at Makers Academy. I am versed in Ruby and Javascript, and have worked on team and individual projects using technologies such as Rails and React.js. I also have gained experience in database management, primarily using PostgreSQL and SQLite3. 

I have always been a process driven individual, leading me to possess strong project management skills. I view my projects as being composed of managable chunks, which I then break down into a series of small steps each systematically following from the last. This may have stemmed from when I was younger, where I would spend hours building puzzles and lego models. The tech industry excites me not only for the trailblazing products that play such a key role in our lives, but rather a fascination to engage with a culture of collaboration and passion that has driven the industry to where it is today.

## Experience

**MG Vintage** (December 2018 - July 2020)  
Head of Supplier Coordination

- Student run start up platform offering an online vintage clothes service, allowing members to rent and swap out items as part of their subscription.
- Oversaw communication with suppliers both domestically and overseas. This venture provided me with experience working with a start-up consumer platform, negotiating wholesale prices, logistics and a strategic insight into UX, and handling payments over a variety of software platforms.

**Freepoint Commodities** (August 2019)  
Intern

- Analysed commodity trading strategies used in tandem with indicator software such as ADX and parabolic SARs that had been developed for tracking price movements.
- Gained experience in learning the basics of algorithmic trading by shadowing the algorithms trading desk aimed at developing trading strategies across oil, natural gas and metal markets.
- Worked in back office processing areas. Tasked with calculations and back testing the payment flow using the systems CXL and EIPP from trade verification to payment release.

## Skills

#### Leadership

- The ability to act as a responsive focal point for the delegation of roles and tasks, as well as for outreach and communication.
- Bank of America Merrill Lynch Spring Insight Week: My team were tasked with researching and presenting the development of the Fintech sector over the past five years. Due to my interest in the industry, I put myself forward to lead the team. I delegated roles based on our individual strengths into analysis and creative teams. The result of this enabled us to give a highly informative presentation on the growth of the industry based on captivating research and a well-designed project.

#### Collaboration

- Using simple yet effective communication skills to bolster collective strategies within a team towards an objective.
- MG Vintage: Tasked with travelling to Italy to purchase stock for new members. This involved negotiating wholesale prices with foreign suppliers whilst establishing a constructive relationship for future deals. The application of effective communication throughout this process led to MG Vintage establishing a primary network of suppliers, allowing us to purchase products at extremely favourable rates.
- Student-led Intramural Football Committee: Working with the teams and local businesses to set up sponsorship deals. Charity shops, barbers, cafes and more were given free advertising in exchange for student discounts.

#### Attention to Detail

- Designing and implementing a meticulous process for a particular task upon which they are executed. Following this process allows me to build greater consistency throughout a project and leaves less room for unforeseen errors.
- Freepoint Commodities: I spent three weeks in back-end operations, using logging software such as CXL and EIPP to verify and backcheck trades on global markets. By following a process throughout the series of tasks, I was able to ensure confidence in my procedures before sending trades off for payment and delivery. Subsequently, my responsibilities grew to the construction of company-wide daily statistic sheets, displaying the daily net value of overall trades on each market.

#### Perseverance

- Freddie's Flowers Salesman: Failing to sell any units in my first week as a door-to-door salesman, I chose to carefully analyse my performance with the help of feedback and support from my team. This led to me picking out two key areas of improvement: resilience and confidence. Consequently, took it upon myself to 'mock pitch' to members of my team until I felt that these targets had been met. Although the effects were not felt immediately, 6 weeks later I rewarded by management for being the top salesman in my team over a three-week period.
