## Christopher Abdo
Graduate from Makers Academy looking to fulfil my passion for solving complex problems in a role in software engineering. My transition into software development enabled me to apply this passion towards designing and creating products with robust, resilient and test-driven code. Products that add value to the lives of consumers. In achieving this, I bring strong leadership, innovative and interpersonal skills developed from my past professional and volunteering experiences. I relish the challenge of learning new things and am now teaching myself Python through personal side projects, as well as carrying out the AWS Cloud Practitioners Course.

## Projects

| Name                         | What it does      | What I did        | Tech/Tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Asset Manager**            |A management tool created for small and medium sized businesses to help accurately and seamlessly track the status of their incoming/outgoing assets.| Developed a feature that automatically scans and pulls asset data from a user’s CSV file, removing the need for customers to manually enter details when adding a new asset.| Django, React.js, PostgreSQL |
| **Looking Glass**            | Web app that allows users to create watchlists and film recommendations based on what their friends have picked for them.| Designed the fetch functions to collect the data from the API. Used that data to create modal components for each film choice. I also led the design of the product, from wireframing using Mockflow, all the way to implementation using CSS. |Ruby-on-Rails, React.js, Rspec |
| **AcebookCLOBS** | A social media clone that allows signed up users to write posts and view a news feed of existing posts with an ability to like and unlike as they wish. | Used effective techniques to learn React.js in a short time-frame. This allowed me to refractor our Rails code to give the user's homescreen complete single-page functionality. |Ruby-on-Rails, React.js, Rspec |
| **MakersBnB** | This website allows users to list their properties for rent, as well as view properties to rent themselves based on available dates. | Designed and implemented a dates reservation system that cross-checks a user's requested dates for properties in that range. This enabled owners to never have double booked properties.|Ruby, Rspec |

## Experience

**MG Vintage** (December 2018 - July 2020)  Head of Supplier Coordination

- Led wholesale price negotiations at a start-up consumer platform. 
-	Coordinated a cross-functional team responsible for creating the company’s first web application. I was in charge of building wireframes for the app’s UI design, which I communicated to the developers.

**Freepoint Commodities** (August 2019)  Internship

- Applied effective self-learning techniques to complete internal training assessments in a range of topics including cash flows, financial concepts and trading strategies scoring > 85% across all 8 assessments.
®	Used error mitigation/attention to detail to back test the payment flow, learning new technologies such as CXL and EIPP. Using an agile approach for this task meant my responsibilities grew to construct company-wide daily statistic spreadsheets.

**Bank of America Merrill Lynch** (March 2015) Spring Insight Week

-	Developed strong problem solving and communication skills working in a project to analyse sources relating to real world economic and geopolitical challenges.

## Skills

#### Perseverance

- Freddie's Flowers Salesman: Failing to sell any units in my first week as a door-to-door salesman, I chose to carefully analyse my performance with the help of feedback and support from my team. This led to me picking out two key areas of improvement: resilience and confidence. Consequently, took it upon myself to 'mock pitch' to members of my team until I felt that these targets had been met. Although the effects were not felt immediately, 6 weeks later I rewarded by management for being the top salesman in my team over a three-week period.

#### Leadership

- Bank of America Merrill Lynch Spring Insight Week: My team were tasked with researching and presenting the development of the Fintech sector over the past five years. Due to my interest in the industry, I put myself forward to lead the team. I delegated roles based on our individual strengths into analysis and creative teams. The result of this enabled us to give a highly informative presentation on the growth of the industry based on captivating research and a well-designed project.

#### Collaboration

- MG Vintage: Tasked with travelling to Italy to purchase stock for new members. This involved negotiating wholesale prices with foreign suppliers whilst establishing a constructive relationship for future deals. The application of effective communication throughout this process led to MG Vintage establishing a primary network of suppliers, allowing us to purchase products at extremely favourable rates.
- Student-led Intramural Football Committee: Working with the teams and local businesses to set up sponsorship deals. Charity shops, barbers, cafes and more were given free advertising in exchange for student discounts.

#### Attention to Detail

- Freepoint Commodities: I spent three weeks in back-end operations, using logging software such as CXL and EIPP to verify and backcheck trades on global markets. By following a process throughout the series of tasks, I was able to ensure confidence in my procedures before sending trades off for payment and delivery. Subsequently, my responsibilities grew to the construction of company-wide daily statistic sheets, displaying the daily net value of overall trades on each market.

## Hobbies
