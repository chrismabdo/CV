. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. The tech industry excites me not only for the trailblazing technologies that play such a key role in our lives, but for the people behind them, the culture that comes with it, and the fundamental ethos of collaboration and passion that has driven the industry to where it is today.

## Experience

**MG Vintage** (December 2018 - June 2020)  
Head of Supplier Cordination

- Student run start up platform offering an online vintage clothes service, allowing members to rent and swap out items as part of their subscription.
- Oversaw communication with suppliers both domestically and overseas. This venture provided me with experience working with a start-up consumer platform, negotiating wholesale prices, logistics and a strategic insight into UX, and handling payments over a variety of software platforms.

**Freepoint Commodities** (August 2019)  
Intern

- Analysed commodity trading strategies used in tandem with indicator softwares such as ADX and parabolic SARs that had been developed for tracking price movements.
- Gained experience in learning the basics of algorithmic trading by shadowing the algorithms trading desk aimed at developing trading strategies across oil, natural gas and metal markets.
- Worked in back office processing areas. Tasked with calculations and back testing the payment flow using the systems CXL and EIPP from trade verification to payment release.

## Skills

#### Leadership

- The ability to act as a responsive focal point for the delegation of roles and tasks, as well as for outreach and communication.
- Bank of America Merril Lynch Spring Insight Week: My team were tasked with researching and presenting the development of the Fintech sector over the past five years. Due to my interest in the industry, I put myself forward to lead the team. I delegated roles based on our individual strengths into analysis and creative teams. The result of this enabled us to give a highly informative presentation on the growth of the industry based on captivating research and a well-designed project.

#### Collaboration

- Using simple yet effective communication skills to bolster collective strategies within a team towards an objective.
- MG Vintage: Tasked with travelling to Italy to purchase stock for new members. This invovled negotiating wholesale prices with foreign suppliers whilst establishing a constructive relationship for future deals. The application of effective communication throughout this process led to MG Vintage establishing a primary network of suppliers, allowing us to purchase products at extremely favourable rates.
- Student-led Intramural Football Committee: Working with the teams and local businesses to set up sonsorship deals. Charity shops, barbers, cafes and more were given free advistising in exchange for student discounts.

#### Attention to Detail

- Desgining and implementing a meticulous process for a particular task upon which they are executed. Following this process allows me to build greater consistency throughout a project and leaves less room for unforseen errors.
- Freepoint Commodities: I spent three weeks in back-end operations, using logging software such as CXL and EIPP to verify and backcheck trades on global markets. By following a process throughout the series of tasks, I was able to ensure confidence in my procedures before sending trades off for payment and delivery. Subsequently, my responsibilities grew to the construction of company wide dily statistic sheets, displaying the daily net value of overall trades on each market.

#### Perseverance

- Freddie's Flowers Salesman: Failing to sell any units in my first week as a door-to-door salesman, I chose to carefully anaylse my performance with the help of feedback and support from my team. This led to me picking out two key areas of improvement: resilience and confidence. Consequently, took it upon myself to 'mock pitch' to members of my team until I felt that these targets had been met. Although the effects were not felt immediately, 6 weeks later I rewarded by management for being the top salesman in my team over a three week period.
